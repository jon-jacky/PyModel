        <h1>PyModel samples</h1>

<p>
<a href="index.html">PyModel</a> is an open-source model-based testing
framework in Python.

<hr>

<p>The <a href="../samples">samples</a> directory contains a
subdirectory for each sample, including a <em>README</em> with
more<br> information about that sample.  The samples are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>abp</em>: models the <em>alternating bit protocol</em>, a simple network<br>
protocol that retransmits lost or corrupted messages.  This model is<br>
a Finite State Machine (FSM).  It shows that an FSM can be<br>
used as the model (not just as a scenario machine).  Just like a<br>
model program, an FSM can generate traces, generate graphics, and be<br>
composed with test suites.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Marquee</em>: a marquee with one line of text scrolling from right to<br>
left.  Demonstrates how the size and structure of the data affect<br>
the number of states, how a configuration file can augment or<br>
replace items in the model, and how composition with a scenario<br>
machine can restrict the behavior of a model.</p></li>
<li><p><em>populations</em>: models a population whose members can be added or<br>
removed.  It demonstrates state-dependent domains.  Since the<br>
population is a collection of random elements, it would not be<br>
possible to define a fixed domain in advance.</p></li>
<li><p><em>PowerSwitch</em>: a very simple model program and an FSM, for an on-off<br>
power switch and a speed control.  Demonstrates several PyModel<br>
techniques (including composition) on a minimal example.</p></li>
<li><p><em>safety</em>: models a microwave oven with a safety condition: the<br>
microwave power can only be on when the oven door is closed.  Shows<br>
how to do safety analysis in PyModel: write <em>invariants</em> (safety<br>
conditions) that describe safe states, then use <em>exploration</em> to<br>
search for unsafe states.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Socket</em>: uses network sockets to demonstrate several PyModel<br>
techniques for modeling and testing systems that exhibit<br>
nondeterminism, concurrency, and asynchrony.  Includes a stepper<br>
(test harness) for testing the Python standard library <em>socket</em><br>
module.  Also includes a simulator that can replace the standard<br><em>socket</em> module with a substitute that can be configured to exhibit<br>
failures and demonstrate nondeterminism.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Stack</em>: models a stack.  Shows how to model return values as action<br>
arguments, write and use strategies to guide testing, use<br><em>StateFilter</em> to exclude states from being reached by the model,<br>
use composition of a model with a test suite to check that the<br>
traces in the test suite conform to the model, and use observable<br>
actions to get action arguments from a composed scenario or test<br>
suite rather than the domains defined in the model.</p></li>
<li><p><em>StackResult</em>: models a stack, in a different style than the <em>Stack</em><br>
sample.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Timeout</em>: demonstrates the <em>pmt -t</em> (that is, <em>--timeout</em>) option.<br>
Shows how a simple test suite can be written to exercise a stepper,<br>
without writing a model program.</p></li>
<li><p><em>tracemultiplexer</em>: Simulate a program where two threads write to<br>
the same log file. Exhibit nondeterminism in scheduling threads. Try<br>
to synchronize so that only one thread at a time can write to the<br>
log.  Detect unsafe states where both threads may write to the log.<br>
Identify log messages that may have been corrupted by unsynchronized<br>
writes from both threads.</p></li>
<li><p><em>WebApplication</em>: contains <em>WebModel</em>, a model for a web<br>
application, <em>webapp</em>, an actual web application implementation (in<br>
Python), and <em>Stepper</em>, a stepper that allows the tester <em>pmt</em> to use<br>
the model to drive the web application.  To test, run <em>webapp</em> on<br><em>localhost</em> using the PyModel <em>wsgirunner</em> command.  <em>Stepper</em> is a<br>
web client.  It simulates a browser, sending HTTP requests to the<br>
web application.</p></li>
