<p>
<a href="index.html">PyModel</a> is an open-source model-based testing
framework in Python.

<hr>

<p>
Usage:
</p>


<pre>
  pma.py [options] models  
</pre>

<p>
models is a list of one or more module names (with no .py suffix).
Each module named in models must contain
a <a href="concepts.html">model</a>, that is: a model program, an FSM,
or a test suite.  In addition, a module named in models can contain
additional configuration information for a model program.  Multiple
models (model programs including configuration, FSMs, and test suites)
are composed into a product.  The analyzer generates a finite state
machine from the product and writes an FSM module that includes the
generated FSM, the explored states, and other results of the analysis.
The FSM module contents can be displayed using the PyModel Graphics
program, <a href="pmg.html">pmg</a>.

Options:

<pre>
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ACTION, --action=ACTION
                        Action to include in generated FSM, as many as needed,

                        Maximum number of transitions to include in the
                        generated FSM, default 100
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        Output module name (with no .py suffix), default is
