stepper_o - synchronous but non-deterministic stepper for msocket

Controllable/observable, synchronous, non-deterministic stepper for socket
(see stepper_d.py header and allabout.txt for explanations).

In this stepper the _return actions are observable, not controllable.
Therefore this stepper supports nondeterminism in return values.

In the test_action branch for each controllable action, the code for
the _call action constructs the observed _return action, which may
include nondeterministic return values.  It appends the _return action
to the observation queue.

Then pmt pops the _return action from the observation queue, then
calls the model to determine whether the observed _return action is
enabled.  So pmt + model determines whether the test passed or failed.
This simplifies the stepper (compare test_action branch for
recv_call/return here to stepper_d.py).

This stepper is still synchronous - each _call action must be
immediately followed by its _return action, otherwise the call to
test_action will block.

Example: pmt -n 10 -c 6 msocket observables synchronous -i stepper_o
