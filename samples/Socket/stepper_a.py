stepper_a - asynchronous stepper using threads.

Controllable/observable, asynchronous, non-deterministic stepper for Socket
(see stepper.py header and README.txt for explanations).

In this stepper the _return actions are observable, not controllable.
Therefore this stepper supports nondeterminism in return values.

In the test_action branch for each controllable action, the code for
the _call action constructs the observed _return action, which may
include nondeterministic return values.  It appends the _return action
to the observation queue.

Then pmt pops the _return action from the observation queue, then
calls the model to determine whether the observed _return action is
enabled.  So pmt + model determines whether the test passed or failed.
This simplifies the stepper (compare test_action branch for
recv_call/return here to stepper_d.py).

This stepper is asynchronous - a _call action need not be immediately
followed by its _return action.  Each _call is handled in its own thread,
so test_action can return even if _call blocks.

Example: pmt -i stepper_a ...
