stepper - asynchronous stepper for msocket using select

Controllable/observable, asynchronous, non-deterministic stepper for msocket
(see README.txt for explanations).

In this stepper the _return actions are observable, not controllable.
Therefore this stepper supports nondeterminism in return values.

In the test_action branch for each controllable action, the code
constructs the call to the implementation.  When select indicates that
the intended call can return, this stepper executes the call, collects
the result, and constructs the observed _return action, which may
include nondeterministic return values.  It appends the _return action
to the observation queue.

Then pmt pops the _return action from the observation queue, then
calls the model to determine whether the observed _return action is
enabled.  So pmt + model determines whether the test passed or failed.
This simplifies the stepper (compare test_action branch for
recv_call/return here to stepper_d.py).

This stepper is asynchronous - a _call action need not be immediately
followed by its _return action.  Instead, each subsequent call to
stepper.wait calls select, which either times out or executes a call,
collects the results, and puts an item into the observation queue.

Example: pmt -i stepper ...

  Then the code calls select, in case the socket connection happens to
  be ready to handle the call immediately.  If select indicates that the
  connection is not ready, test_action returns, so the caller (the test
  runner pmt) does not block.  After that, the test runner pmt
  periodically calls this stepper's wait() function, which in turn calls
  select.
